## Architecture

![Architecture](Coalfire-GCP-RAMPpak.png)

## Tooling

- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) (435.0.0)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (1.5.0)
- [Terraform Google Cloud Platform Provider Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google) (4.70.0)

## Dependencies

1. [Setup Cloud Identity](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/set-up-cloud-identity-admin) and [verify your domain](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/verify-domain).
2. After Cloud Identity has been configured, [create an organization](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization).
    - Turn on 2-Step Verification enforcement.
3. Create `grp-gcp-org-admins@your-domain.com` group in Cloud Identity and add members.
    - Add **Security** label to group.
    - Select **Restricted** Access type.
4. Create FedRAMP Moderate Assured Workloads folder in [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) on the **Assured Workloads** page. Assured Workloads is required for FedRAMP compliance as Google doesn't have a GovCloud offering.
    - Compliance type: **FedRAMP Moderate**
    - Region: **US**
    - Folder location: **choose organization**
    - Folder name: `fldr-assured-workloads`
    - Review and create folder
